# Portable JDK 8u112 for Windows x64 #

This is a portable version of JDK 8u112 for Windows x64.

### Why portable JDK? ###


* Installing a software is all about adding new files to your local machine and editing some of the existing cÄ±onfiguration files. Since JDK needs almost no editing on existing files, it's perfectly legitimate to just copying them to computer.

### How do I get set up? ###

*  just clone this repository wherever you want:


```
#!cmd

mkdir c:\JDK
cd c:\JDK
git clone https://bitbucket.org/ramazanpolat/jdk-8u112-windows-x64

```



That's it. Now you have installed JDK 8u112.
